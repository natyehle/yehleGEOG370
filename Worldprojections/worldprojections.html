    <h1>World Projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:rgb(120, 199, 245)">Homework 2</h2>
    <p>For this project, I learned how to display maps in different projections using QGIS. It is important to know about different map projections because each one shows Earth and it geographical features a little bit differently. Since the planet is a three-dimensional ellipsoid, it cannot be projected onto a flat surface without sacrificing either shape (conformity), area, or a combination of both. Geographers have discovered several different projections that can display the Earth on a flat surface, but each one has different trade offs that make it best suited for a specific purpose.</p>
    
    <h2>World Geodetic System of 1984 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map is used by the United States Department of Defense. It is also used by many countries for aviation navigation. It preserves shape, but does not have equal-area especially by the poles.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Aitoff is a modified azimuthal projection, where the coordinate system follows an ellipse pattern. It is neither equal-area nor conformal. It is appropriate for small-scale mapping where accurate area is not required.</h3>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator</h2>
    <h3>The Mercator is the de facto standard for Web-based mapping services, such as Google Maps. Shape is preserved extremely well, but there is size distortion. For example on this map, Greenland and Africa look to be the same size, but in reality Africa is 14 times larger.</h3>

    <h2>Winkle I Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Winkle I projection is a pseudo-cylindrical map with parallel longitudes, but lattitudes that follow an ellipse shape. It is neither equal-area nor conformal. The Winkle I is appropriate for general world map use, but not typically advised because there are better options.</h3>

    <h2>Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>This cylindrical projection displays the world as a rectangle while maintaining relative area. It is equal-area, but shapes are distorted the further they are from the equator. This projection is appropriate for large-scale mapping of areas near the equator, such as Indonesia.</h3>

    <h2>Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>The equidistant conic projection displays the Earth as a flattened cone. On this projection, shapes, areas, distances, and directions are generally distorted. The equidistant conic projection is appropriate for land masses extending east-to-west at mid-latitudes when it is not necessary to maintain area, directions, and angles. It is usually used for mapping Russia.</h3>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>In this projection, the Earth is projected on to a flat surface from the North Pole. This projection preserves distance and direction from the central point on the map. However, shape, scale, and area distortion increase further away from the central point. Although it can be used for world maps, this projection is usually used for mapping of the poles.</h3>

    <h2>Bonne Sphere Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection, despite the name, is pseudo-conic. It is equal-area, but not conformal. Historically, it was used during the 19th and early 20th centuries for atlas maps of Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Today, because there are more functional options, it is used artistically to show the world in a heart shape.</h3>

    <h2>Polyconic World Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is made by alining  an infinite number of cones along the central meridian. It is neither conformal nor equal-area, except along the central meridian. This projection does not have many modern day usages; however, it was used by the United States Geological Survery for toppgraphic quad sheets from 1886-1957.</h3>
